# Salesforce Connector

This is an Arrow connector to Salesforce.

## Installation

```bash
$ appc install connector/appc.salesforce
```

You need to set the following configuration:

- *url* URL to salesforce instance
- *username* Login username
- *password* Login password
- *token* Login token

## Usage

Reference the connector in your model.

```javascript
var Account = Arrow.createModel('Account',{
	fields: {
		Name: { type: String, required: true, validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/ }
	},
	connector: 'appc.salesforce'
});
```

If you want to map a specific model to a specific sobject name, use metadata.  For example, to map the `account` model to the sobject `Account`, set it such as:

```javascript
var Account = Arrow.createModel('account',{
	fields: {
		Name: { type: String, required: false, validator: /[a-zA-Z]{3,}/ }
	},
	connector: 'appc.salesforce',
	metadata: {
		'appc.salesforce': {
			object: 'Account'
		}
	}
});
```

### Authenticating Through Salesforce

You can pass authentication through this connector on to Salesforce by changing the configuration. To get started,
set `requireSessionLogin` to `true` for the Salesforce connector:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	connectors: {
		'appc.salesforce': {
			...
			requireSessionLogin: true
			...
		}
	}
};
```

This property allows you to configure whether or not anonymous requests can use your default account (specified in your
configuration files) for connecting to Salesforce. Set this to "true" to require requests to specify their own
credentials or their own session token (via the headers user, and pass, or accesstoken).

With it set to true, call any of the REST APIs on a Salesforce model, such as Account.findAll, and provide credentials
via headers:

```bash
curl --header "user: sfUsername" --header "pass: sfPassword" --header "token: sfToken" http://localhost:8080/api/appc.salesforce/account
```

Note that you can also use the "loginurl" header here, which will override what was specified in the configuration.

The request will execute, and you will either get back an error if the login failed, or you will get the results of the 
findAll query. You will also get back the headers "accesstoken" and "instanceurl". For future requests, pass these
headers back instead of the user, pass, and token headers. This allows us to re-use the session.

```bash
curl --header "accesstoken: theAccessToken" --header "instanceurl: theInstanceURL" http://localhost:8080/api/appc.salesforce/account
```

## Development

> This section is for individuals developing the Salesforce Connector and not intended
  for end-users.

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

### Running Unit Tests

Copy the following to local.js and update the login parameters with your own, then you can run the unit tests.

```javascript
module.exports = {
	logLevel: 'error',
	connectors: {
		'appc.salesforce.1': {
			connector: 'appc.salesforce',
			requireSessionLogin: false,
			url: 'https://test.salesforce.com/',
			username: 'your_salesforce_username',
			password: 'your_salesforce_password',
			token: 'your_salesforce_token',
			schemaRefresh: 3.6e+6 * 24, // one day
			modelAutogen: true,
			generateModelsFromSchema: true,
			generateModels: [
				'Account',
				'Contract'
			]
		},
		'appc.salesforce.2': {
			connector: 'appc.salesforce',
			requireSessionLogin: false,
			url: 'https://test.salesforce.com/',
			username: 'your_salesforce_username',
			password: 'your_salesforce_password',
			token: 'your_salesforce_token',
			schemaRefresh: 3.6e+6 * 24, // one day
			modelAutogen: true,
			generateModelsFromSchema: true,
			generateModels: [
				'Account',
				'Contract'
			]
		}
	}
};
```

```bash
npm test
```
